The previous AI engineer successfully developed an e-commerce application from scratch, focusing on a responsive, user-friendly design with core functionalities. The development trajectory highlights a highly iterative process, initially addressing fundamental features like authentication and product display, then moving onto UI/UX refinements, modularization, and performance optimizations. The engineer demonstrated strong adaptability by addressing explicit user feedback, including critical issues like performance bottlenecks and missing features (cart, contact info). A significant part of the conversation also involved clarifying platform capabilities regarding local vs. cloud deployment and implementing multiple authentication systems (Emergent Auth, JWT, and currently, OAuth2). The work involved extensive file modifications across frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI), including setting up new components, contexts, hooks, API endpoints, and database indexes. The current state is poised for final OAuth2 testing.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an e-commerce website with product management, visitor tracking, and cross-device responsiveness. Key requirements included a minimalist design, a client-centric approach, and a robust registration system with email verification and distinct administrator/visitor roles.

So far, the application features:
1.  **Authentication System**: Initially set up with Emergent Authentication, then transitioned to a custom JWT-based system, and is now being configured for Google OAuth2.
2.  **Role Separation**: Basic distinction between admin and regular user roles implemented in the backend (for JWT auth).
3.  **Responsive Design**: Mobile adaptability with a 1x2 product grid, improved mobile menu, and adaptive product cards.
4.  **Homepage Slideshows**: Dynamic product slideshows from the database and dedicated Hero section slideshows for both mobile and desktop.
5.  **Modular Architecture**: Codebase is refactored into separate desktop, mobile, and common components, using React Context for global state (Auth, Device, Cart) and custom hooks.
6.  **Device Switching**: Automatic device detection with a manual toggle.
7.  **Product Management**: Scripts to populate MongoDB with product data. A product catalog page with filters and sorting.
8.  **Shopping Cart**: Full shopping cart functionality with add/remove items and dedicated cart pages for desktop and mobile.
9.  **Contact Information**: Call us and contact details integrated into navigation.
10. **Performance Optimizations**: Implemented React Query for API caching, virtualization for product lists, lazy loading for images, code splitting, Service Worker for offline caching, and database indexing.

**Detailed Directory Structure:**



**Key Files and Changes:**

*   **/app/backend/server.py**: Transformed from basic product endpoints to a comprehensive API with authentication (initially Emergent, then JWT, now OAuth2), product filtering/search, and category statistics. It now relies on  or  for core authentication logic and handles product/category data from MongoDB.
*   **/app/backend/auth.py**: *Newly created* to encapsulate JWT-based user registration, login, password hashing, and token generation/verification logic. This file became central for custom authentication.
*   **/app/backend/oauth_auth.py**: *Newly created* to manage Google OAuth2 authentication flow, including token exchange and user data retrieval. This file is the latest iteration of authentication implementation.
*   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The central hub. It was progressively refactored to manage global state (Auth, Device, Cart Contexts), implement routing for various pages (, , , ), dynamically render desktop/mobile views, and integrate performance optimizations like  and .
*   **/app/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.js**: *Modified*. Initially a placeholder, then fully implemented to handle JWT login, registration, and logout, managing user state and access tokens using  and  interceptors. A separate  was created for the new OAuth2 integration.
*   **/app/frontend/src/contexts/CartContext.js**: *Newly created* to provide global state management for the shopping cart, allowing items to be added, removed, and quantity updated across the application.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/Common/ProductCard.js**: A fundamental component for displaying product details. It was modified to incorporate an Add to Cart button that interacts with , and underwent debugging for  prop issues.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/Desktop/DesktopProducts.js** and **Mobile/MobileProducts.js**: Initially scaffolded for product display. They were later modified to accept URL parameters for filtering and sorting. Ultimately, optimized versions () were introduced to leverage  for virtualization and  for React Query integration to improve performance with large datasets.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/Desktop/DesktopCategories.js** and **Mobile/MobileCategories.js**: *Newly created* to display product categories, including statistics fetched via  hook. They incorporate UI for quick filters.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/Desktop/DesktopCart.js** and **Mobile/MobileCart.js**: *Newly created* to provide dedicated pages for users to view and manage their shopping cart contents.
*   **/app/add_demo_products.py**, **/app/add_more_products.py**, **/app/create_indexes.py**: Initial Python scripts for database seeding and indexing. These were later adapted and simplified into  versions and consolidated into  to facilitate easier local setup on Windows.
*   **/app/frontend/public/sw.js**: *Newly created* to implement Service Worker functionality, enabling basic offline caching and performance improvements for the frontend.
*   **/app/create_indexes_local.py**, **/app/add_demo_products_local.py**: *Newly created* as simplified, synchronous versions of the original database scripts, specifically for local Windows environments to address previous runtime errors.
*   **/app/setup_database.py**, **/app/start_backend.bat**, **/app/start_frontend.bat**, **/app/setup_all.bat**: *Newly created* to streamline the local setup and launch process for the entire application on Windows, providing clear, executable scripts for the user.
*   **/app/backend/.env** and **/app/frontend/.env**: Crucial for environment variable management (, , ). They were identified as critical for correct service communication and updated when troubleshooting product loading issues and setting up JWT authentication.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in a significant refactoring of the application's authentication system. The user had initially requested an alternative to Emergent Auth and the AI had successfully implemented a custom JWT-based authentication system, including backend API routes, a new  on the frontend, and a dedicated  component. This system allowed for user registration and login with local test accounts.

Following this, the user explicitly requested a further change to OAuth2 authentication. In response, the AI engineer initiated the implementation of Google OAuth2. This involved:
1.  **Backend Changes**: Creating  to handle the OAuth2 flow (e.g., token exchange, user creation/lookup from Google). Modifications to  to integrate these new OAuth2 endpoints. Updated backend dependencies in .
2.  **Frontend Changes**: Creating a new  to manage the OAuth2 state, a  component for the UI, and updated navigation components (, ) to integrate the new login method. An alternative  was also created.
3.  **Local Deployment Utilities**: New batch scripts (, , ) and documentation (, ) were generated to facilitate local testing and deployment of the OAuth2 version.
4.  **Testing Infrastructure**: Created , , , and  in preparation for testing the newly implemented OAuth2 system.

The work is currently at the stage where all the necessary files for OAuth2 integration have been created and modified. The next logical step, as indicated by the AI's last message, is to test this newly implemented OAuth2 system.
