The previous AI engineer successfully brought the e-commerce application from a zero state to a functional MVP, focusing on core user requirements. The development trajectory highlights an iterative approach, starting with foundational elements like authentication and then progressively adding UI/UX enhancements and modularization. Key challenges included initial setup, managing file truncations during edits, and ensuring responsiveness across devices. The engineer addressed explicit user feedback meticulously, leading to a refined application with separate desktop and mobile interfaces, dynamic slideshows, and an emerging product catalog. The current state reflects a robust, modularized frontend and a populated backend, poised for further feature development, particularly around product filtering and categories.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an e-commerce website where they can add products, track visitors, and ensure responsiveness across devices. The site needed a minimalist yet user-friendly design with a client-centric approach. A registration system with email verification (name, optional surname/phone, email, password, repeat password, Google password generation suggestion) was required. A critical distinction was the need for separate administrator and visitor access, with robust security beyond hosting provisions, including cross-site protection.

So far, the application features:
1.  **Authentication System**: User registration and login functionality, potentially utilizing Emergent Authentication.
2.  **Role Separation**: Basic setup for distinguishing between administrator and regular user roles.
3.  **Responsive Design**: Mobile adaptability with products displayed in a 1x2 grid, improved mobile menu, and adaptive product cards.
4.  **Homepage Slideshows**:
    *   Product slideshow on the main page (desktop and mobile) showcasing items from the database.
    *   Dedicated Hero section slideshows for both mobile and desktop versions, featuring various themed images with navigation and auto-scrolling.
5.  **Modular Architecture**: Codebase refactored into separate desktop, mobile, and common components, using React Context for state management (Auth, Device) and custom hooks.
6.  **Device Switching**: Automatic device detection with a manual toggle for switching between desktop and mobile views, saving preferences in local storage.
7.  **Product Management**: Script for adding demo products with base64 encoded images. Initial structure for a product catalog page with filters and sorting options.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Development**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **Authentication**: Emergent Authentication system for user registration/login, including Google OAuth integration.
-   **UI/UX**: Tailwind CSS for responsive and advanced UI patterns.
-   **State Management**: React Context API for global state (Auth, Device context).
-   **Data Handling**: Base64 encoding for image storage in MongoDB.
-   **Modularity**: Code split into reusable components, hooks, and utilities.
-   **API Integration**: Backend API routes prefixed with  for Kubernetes ingress.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.

**Detailed Directory Structure:**



**Key Files and Changes:**

*   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    *   **Importance**: The core FastAPI backend application handling API requests, database interactions, and authentication.
    *   **Changes**: Initial setup for FastAPI, integration with Emergent Authentication (though code for full integration wasn't shown), basic product endpoints (implied by frontend's  hook), and CORS handling. Rewritten multiple times for new features and bug fixes.
*   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    *   **Importance**: The main React component, responsible for routing, global state provision (AuthContext, DeviceContext), and conditionally rendering Desktop or Mobile interfaces based on device type.
    *   **Changes**: Initially contained all UI logic. Progressively refactored to incorporate modular components (, , , , ), routing for different pages (, , , ), and logic for device detection and switching. Bug fixes for mobile menu duplication and hero section button alignment were also applied here.
*   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**:
    *   **Importance**: Contains global CSS styles and foundational Tailwind CSS imports.
    *   **Changes**: Updated to include styles for the slideshow components, mobile navigation, and general responsiveness, including specific CSS animations for slideshow progress bars.
*   **/app/frontend/src/contexts/DeviceContext.js**:
    *   **Importance**: Provides and manages the current device mode (desktop, mobile, auto) and the function to switch modes across the application.
    *   **Changes**: Newly created to encapsulate device detection and preference storage (localStorage).
*   **/app/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.js**:
    *   **Importance**: Intended to manage user authentication state globally.
    *   **Changes**: Newly created. The full implementation details for user state management were not explicitly detailed, but its purpose is defined.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/Desktop/DesktopHome.js**:
    *   **Importance**: Renders the homepage content specifically for desktop users, including the Hero section and product carousel.
    *   **Changes**: Newly created. Includes a new Hero section with an image slideshow (featuring six diverse images), statistics, and action buttons.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/Mobile/MobileHome.js**:
    *   **Importance**: Renders the homepage content specifically for mobile users.
    *   **Changes**: Newly created. Includes a compact Hero section with its own image slideshow (featuring five diverse images), categories, and simplified action buttons.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/Desktop/DesktopProducts.js**:
    *   **Importance**: Renders the product catalog page for desktop users, including filters and product display.
    *   **Changes**: Newly created. Contains UI for a sidebar with filters (search, category, price, sort) and a product display area.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/Mobile/MobileProducts.js**:
    *   **Importance**: Renders the product catalog page for mobile users.
    *   **Changes**: Newly created. Intended to provide an optimized product catalog experience for mobile, mirroring desktop functionality.
*   **/app/add_demo_products.py & /app/add_more_products.py**:
    *   **Importance**: Python scripts to populate the MongoDB database with initial and additional product data, including base64 encoded images.
    *   **Changes**: Created to address the lack of product data for UI demonstration.  was initially created and later fixed for a  KeyError.  was created to add more diverse data.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement and debug the product catalog functionality to ensure products are displayed correctly after filtering and searching.
-   Further develop and integrate product categories, as requested by the user, likely involving backend API changes and frontend UI updates for category filtering.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on setting up the product catalog functionality.
The frontend scaffolding for both  and  has been created, and the main  file has been updated to include routes to these new catalog pages.
Additionally, a new Python script () was created and executed to populate the database with more diverse product data (12 additional products).
However, upon testing the catalog, the frontend indicated Загружаем товары... (Loading products...) and Найдено товаров: 0 (Found products: 0), suggesting that products are not being fetched or displayed correctly. The user explicitly requested to work on categories next, indicating a need to ensure product data, filtering by category, and the overall catalog display function as intended. The AI's last action was to confirm it would check the API and add more categories, implying the next step is debugging product loading and implementing category management.

<optional_next_step>
Check the backend API for product fetching issues and implement product categories for filtering.
